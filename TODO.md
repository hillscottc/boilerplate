# TODO
- Comics Category data and sorting
- Add blue or green cover icon with rollover thumbnail
- Comic fields needed: ISSN+Page, Issue Number, CMC Yes/No, Cover Content Source, Interior Content Source, Pages
- Text a little smaller?
- The filters say "None Selected" when you have not selected any filter items. The "none" could be confusing to some so we should use alternate text.  Something like "Select" or "All" if nothing is selected. 
- Put the JSON funcs into asp_includes
- PageLog table?
- Visible err when json is bad? Email errs to devs here?
- find any hardcoded refs to Dev box in style links
- reset search options. too slow?

## Needs clarification
- "Ensure that DMPC links are working."
- "Searching for Art Pools displayed the expected checkmark but it was not a clickable link."
